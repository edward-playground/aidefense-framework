malicious_command_arg = 'legit_file.txt; rm -rf /'

# Safely quote the argument to treat it as a single, literal string
safe_arg = shlex.quote(malicious_command_arg)

# The final command is now safe
final_command = f"ls -l {safe_arg}"
print(f"Final command to be executed: {final_command}")
# It will look for a single file named 'legit_file.txt; rm -rf /'
# instead of executing the malicious 'rm' command.
