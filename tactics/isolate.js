To mitigate this, you can partition the database into different 'namespaces' or 'collections' based on the data's source and trust level. An agent's access can then be restricted to only the namespaces relevant and safe for its current task.</p><h5>Step 1: Use Namespaces in Your Vector Database</h5><p>Modern vector databases support namespaces, allowing you to logically partition your data within a single index.</p><pre><code># File: agent_memory/partitioned_rag.py\\nfrom qdrant_client import QdrantClient, models\n\n# 1. Ingest data into different namespaces based on source\\nclient = QdrantClient(\\\":memory:\\\")\\n# Create a collection that can be partitioned\\nclient.recreate_collection(\\n    collection_name=\\\"long_term_memory\\\",\\n    vectors_config=models.VectorParams(size=10, distance=models.Distance.COSINE)\\n)\\n\n# Ingest public data into the 'public' namespace\\nclient.upsert(collection_name=\\\"long_term_memory\\\", points=..., namespace=\\\"public_docs\\\")\\n# Ingest sensitive, internal data into the 'internal' namespace\\nclient.upsert(collection_name=\\\"long_term_memory\\\", points=..., namespace=\\\"internal_docs\\\")</code></pre><h5>Step 2: Restrict RAG Queries to Specific Namespaces</h5><p>When the agent performs a RAG query, the application logic should select the appropriate namespace based on the user's trust level or the context of the query.</p><pre><code>def perform_rag_query(user_id, query_embedding):\\n    # Determine the user's access level\\n    user_trust_level = get_user_trust_level(user_id) # e.g., 'public' or 'internal'\\n    \n    allowed_namespaces = []\\n    if user_trust_level == 'public':\\n        allowed_namespaces = [\\\"public_docs\\\"]\\n    elif user_trust_level == 'internal':\\n        allowed_namespaces = [\\\"public_docs\\\", \\\"internal_docs\\\"]\n\n    # The key is to restrict the search to only the allowed namespaces\\n    search_results = []\\n    for ns in allowed_namespaces:\\n        search_results.extend(\\n            client.search(collection_name=\\\"long_term_memory\\\", query_vector=query_embedding, namespace=ns)\\n        )\\n    return search_results</code></pre><p><strong>Action:</strong> Organize your RAG data sources into separate collections or namespaces in your vector database based on their trust level (e.g., `public`, `authenticated_user`, `internal_sensitive`). In your RAG retrieval logic, ensure that queries are restricted to only the namespaces appropriate for the user's permission level.</p>"

Patch Deployed:** The fix for the root cause has been deployed to all relevant systems (e.g., code patched, firewall rule updated).\n- [ ] **1.3. Artifact Integrity Verified:** Run the file integrity monitor (`AID-D-004`) on all model and container artifacts to ensure they have not been tampered with.\n- [ ] **1.4. State Cleared:** All potentially poisoned agent memory caches and conversational history databases have been flushed.\n\n## Phase 2: Staged Restart\n- [ ] **2.1. Restart in Safe Mode:** The system is restarted with high-risk capabilities (e.g., agentic tools, automated outbound communication) disabled.\n- [ ] **2.2. Health Checks Pass:** All standard system health checks are green.\n- [ ] **2.3. Targeted Testing:** Run a suite of tests that specifically try to trigger the original fault. Confirm the patch works.\n\n## Phase 3: Service Restoration\n- [ ] **3.1. Restore Full Functionality:** If all checks pass, disable 'safe mode' and restore full system capabilities.\n- [ ] **3.2. Monitor Closely:** The system is under heightened monitoring for the next 24 hours.\n- [ ] **3.3. Post-Mortem Scheduled:** A blameless post-mortem has been scheduled to discuss the incident.</code></pre><p><strong>Action:</strong> Create a formal restart checklist.
