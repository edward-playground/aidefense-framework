Checkpoint Overview\n- **System:** Payment Processing Bot\n- **Purpose:** To get manual approval for any automated transaction over $10,000 USD to prevent catastrophic financial errors.\n\n## 2. Trigger Condition\n- An AI agent attempts to execute a single transaction where `amount > 10000`.\n\n## 3. Operator Interface\n- **Tool:** SentinelOne SOAR Platform\n- **Alert Name:** `AI-Payment-Approval-Required`\n- **Link to Dashboard:** `https://soar.example.com/cases/ai-approvals`\n\n## 4. Step-by-Step Procedure\n\n1.  **Acknowledge the alert** in the SOAR platform within 5 minutes.\n2.  **Verify the context data** displayed in the case:\n    - `transaction_id`: Cross-reference this with the main payment ledger.\n    - `amount`: Ensure it matches the alert threshold.\n    - `recipient`: **CRITICAL:** Verify the recipient is a known, approved vendor.\n    - `agent_justification`: Review the agent's reason. Does it make sense?\n3.  **Make a Decision:**\n    - **To APPROVE:**\n        - Press the **'Approve Transaction'** button in the SOAR case.\n        - Add a comment with your justification (e.g., \"Confirmed with PO #12345\").\n    - **To REJECT:**\n        - Press the **'Reject Transaction'** button.\n        - Add a comment (e.g., \"Recipient not on approved vendor list\").\n\n## 5. Expected System Responses\n- **On Approval:** The payment agent's log will show `Payment ... processed successfully after HITL-CP-001 approval.`\n- **On Rejection:** The payment agent's log will show `Payment ... halted by HITL-CP-001 rejection.` The case will be closed.\n\n## 6. Common Mistakes & Pitfalls\n- **WARNING:** Do not approve transactions to unfamiliar recipients.

For NVIDIA GPUs, you can use `nvidia-smi`.</p><pre><code># Query NVIDIA GPU firmware version\n> nvidia-smi --query-gpu=firmware_version --format=csv,noheader\n# Expected output: 535.161.07\n\n# On a fleet of machines, this command would be run by a configuration\n# management agent (like Ansible, Puppet) or a monitoring agent.</code></pre><h5>Step 2: Compare Against a Policy</h5><p>Maintain a policy file that specifies the minimum required firmware version for each piece of hardware in your fleet.

The LLM hallucinates or generates plausible but incorrect answers.\n    * *Mitigation:* Implement fact-checking against the retrieved context; show citations to the source documents (`AID-D-009`).\n\n### Layer 2: Data Operations\n\n* **Threat:** Compromised RAG Pipelines (Data Poisoning). An attacker injects malicious documents into the knowledge base, causing the bot to provide harmful or biased answers.\n    * *Mitigation:* Implement data sanitization and source verification on all ingested documents (`AID-H-002`). Maintain data versioning and integrity checks (`AID-H-003.003`).\n* **Threat:** Data Exfiltration. An attacker crafts prompts to extract sensitive information from the RAG documents that they shouldn't have access to.\n    * *Mitigation:* Apply user-based access controls on the document chunks within the vector database; filter model outputs for sensitive information (`AID-H-004`, `AID-D-003`).\n\n### Layer 3: Agent Framework\n\n* **Threat:** Input Validation Attacks (Prompt Injection). An attacker's prompt bypasses the RAG context and causes the LLM to ignore its instructions or execute unintended actions.\n    * *Mitigation:* Use structured prompt templates with clear delimiters; sanitize user input before passing it to the LLM (`AID-H-002.002`).\n\n### Layer 4: Deployment & Infrastructure\n\n* **Threat:** Misconfigurations. The vector database is accidentally exposed to the public internet.\n    * *Mitigation:* Use Infrastructure as Code (IaC) with automated security scanning; implement network policies to deny public ingress (`AID-M-005`, `AID-H-006`).</code></pre><p><strong>Action:</strong> As a mandatory step in your design phase, create a threat model document using the MAESTRO framework.

IAM Policy Review\n- [ ] **Initial Finding:** The compromised service role had `s3:*` permissions.\n- [ ] **Hardening Action:** The policy was replaced with a new one granting only `s3:GetObject` on `arn:aws:s3:::my-bucket/input/*` and `s3:PutObject` on `arn:aws:s3:::my-bucket/output/*`.\n\n### 2. Input Validation Review\n- [ ] **Initial Finding:** The prompt injection attack used a new Base64 encoding trick.\n- [ ] **Hardening Action:** The input validation service (`AID-H-002`) has been updated with a new rule to detect and block Base64-encoded strings in prompts.\n\n### 3. Network Segmentation Review\n- [ ] **Initial Finding:** The attacker moved laterally from the web server to the model server.\n- [ ] **Hardening Action:** A new `NetworkPolicy` (`AID-I-002`) has been deployed, restricting access to the model server pod to only the API gateway pod.\n\n### 4. Logging & Monitoring Review\n- [ ] **Initial Finding:** The attack pattern was not detected by automated alerts.\n- [ ] **Hardening Action:** A new SIEM detection rule (`AID-D-005`) has been created to alert on the specific TTPs used in this incident.</code></pre><p><strong>Action:</strong> Following any security incident, create and complete a hardening checklist.
