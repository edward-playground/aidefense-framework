### üöÄ Live Demo

**[Go to the AIDEFEND framework site](https://edward-playground.github.io/aidefense-framework/)**

### üí° Key Features

* **Three Strategic Views**: Organize and explore defenses from multiple perspectives to suit different roles and use cases:
    * **Tactics View**: Aligned with the seven high-level tactics of MITRE D3FEND.
    * **Pillars View**: Organized by technology stack components (Data, Model, Infrastructure, Application).
    * **Phases View**: Structured around the AI development and operational lifecycle.
* **Comprehensive Technique Details**: Each defensive technique includes a detailed description, implementation strategies with code examples, and lists of relevant open-source and commercial tools.
* **Threat Mapping**: Techniques are explicitly mapped to known threats from established frameworks like **MITRE ATLAS**, **MAESTRO**, and the **OWASP Top 10** for LLMs and ML.
* **Interactive Interface**: A clean, responsive UI with powerful search functionality to quickly find relevant techniques and threats.
* **Light & Dark Modes**: A comfortable viewing experience for any environment.

### üèõÔ∏è The Framework Views

AIDEFEND allows you to view the defensive landscape through three distinct lenses, helping you answer key strategic questions.

#### **1. Tactics View**
> **Question:** *What high-level approach and concept is being used for this defense?*

This view organizes techniques by their strategic security function, aligned with the seven defensive tactics: **Model, Harden, Detect, Isolate, Deceive, Evict, and Restore**. It is ideal for security strategists and architects designing a defense-in-depth plan.

#### **2. Pillars View**
> **Question:** *What part (component) of the AI system is being protected?*

This view organizes defenses by the technology stack component they secure: **Data, Model, Infrastructure, or Application**. This component-centric view helps technical roles like ML Engineers and Cloud Security Engineers find controls relevant to their work.

#### **3. Phases View**
> **Question:** *When (what stage) in the AI lifecycle should this defense be applied?*

This view organizes defenses by the development stage where they are most relevant, from initial **Design & Scoping** through **Building, Validation, Operation, Incident Response, and Restoration**. This process-driven view helps MLOps and DevSecOps teams embed security throughout the entire AI lifecycle.

### ‚öôÔ∏è How to Use This Tool

1.  **Select a View**: Use the "View by:" switcher at the top of the page to choose between Tactics, Pillars, or Phases.
2.  **Explore Techniques**: Click on any column header to learn more about that tactic, pillar, or phase. Click on any individual defensive technique to open a detailed modal view.
3.  **Search Everything**: Use the search bar to filter all content by keywords, technique IDs, or threat mappings (e.g., "Prompt Injection", "AID-H-002", "MAESTRO", "LLM01").
